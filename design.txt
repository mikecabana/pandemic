Design 

I chose to heavely relly on an inheritance design for this part of the project. This is because I knew that each type of player card would have its own class AND need to be part of a single deck. So every player card type has its own derived class (City, Event, Epidemic) with a base class of PlayerCard. PlayerCard becomes an abstract class and allowed me to create a deck class that would create player hands and the player deck of type PlayerCards which encompasses all cards for this part. I also chose this scheme because I figured it would come in handy down the road for this project.
